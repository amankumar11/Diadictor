<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="./static/media/ss1.PNG" alt="Logo" width="600" height="300">

Diadictor helps you predict what are your chances of having diabetes using machine learning. The user just needs to enter some basic information and the result is shown within seconds, the result is also mailed to the user so that the user has a report that he can refer in future as well. Apart from predicting diabetes it also helps the user to predict what are his/her chances of having black fungus if he/she has ever suffered from covid-19.
The diadictor application not stops here but also helps the user to find diabetologist in their city by using the practo application. Diadictor also has a community page where doctors can come and write useful blogs about diabetes for the patients so that they can read them.

Here's why:
* India is home to 77 Million Diabetics, 2nd highest in the world.
* Bhubaneshwar has 2nd highest number of diabetic patients in India.
* Odisha 6th In Diabetic Deaths In Country.
* Due to the pandemic situation people try to avoid traveliing and going out in public in such a case using Diadictor will help them get an idea about there chances of having diabetes.
* People who suffer from diabetes and who have contacted covid-19 are at a great risk of being infected with black fungus. So we expanded our domain and  added     black fungus risk teller. 
* If the patient feels he/she has slight chances of having diabetes and is confused whether to consult a doctor or not, Diadictor helps you resolve this issue by giving you a prediction on the scale of 10 and even suggesting doctors.

Diadictor is a useful website that helps the patient predict his chances of having diabetes with an accuracy of 76.04% with 4.5% standard deviation, further user can also schedule an appointment with a doctor in his city.
We hope to make diabetes testing in India much easier as it was before.
